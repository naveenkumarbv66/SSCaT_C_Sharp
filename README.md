Small Scale Cashless Transaction (SSCaT)

Small Scale Cashless Transaction (SSCaT) is intended to revolutionise day to day shopping experience or “transaction methodology” in the broad spectrum. 
Technological advancement has provided easy access to the use of mobile phone to everyone; however, the age-old method of transaction through cash has remained. The era of Credit Cards & Swipe machines has eliminated the need to carry cash to complete a transaction, especially bigger ones. 
SSCaT mimics this principle to complete a transaction, but on a smaller scale through the use of mobile phone – a gadget everyone ought to be having these days.

A SSCaT begins with a customer approaching a retailer for a commodity. The customer purchases the required commodity & sends a ‘purchase’ request to the service provider. The service provider deducts the amount from the customer’s SSCaT account and credits the same to the retailer’s account. 
The service provider acknowledges the transaction and sends the acknowledgement to the customer and the retailer. Security is offered to the customer with the help of a PIN which has to be entered while sending a ‘purchase’ request. 
Customer regularly recharges his SSCaT account, or withdraws cash at select outlets. 
Considering the need for rapid implementation which can be accommodated within the domain of current technology, SSCaT account can be limited to a certain amount, say, a three-digit figure, and can be treated as being similar to prepaid recharge and deductions

Aim  of  SSCaT:
>> A society devoid of wallets and currency notes.
>> Use of mobile phones for transaction.
>> To provide safe, secure & scalable model to implement the cashless concept
>> To present a model requiring no major technological modifications, as a necessity, to be implemented. 

Advantages:
>>	Eliminates the need to carry cash.
>>	Ticket booking, payment of bills, even phone recharge can be done on-spot
>>	With future developments in technology which may assure more security, the concept of   SSCaT can be extended to handle every other transaction, whether large or small.

Disadvantages:
>>	With the concept of cash eliminated, a person may lose or forget to carry his phone
>>	All major disadvantages associated with this concept are technology dependent. More the security, larger the domain of transaction, more the features.

Hardware Requirements:
>> Wavecom Modem
>> Necessary connecting cables & ports
>> A PC during development phase
>> 65 MB RAM 2 to 3 MB of Memory Space

Software Requirements:
>> Microsoft Visual C#

Conclusion
>> The use of representative-money ended the era of using commodity-money[barter] for transactions. This project presents a model meant to revolutionize the current system of transaction.
>> Against Airtel Money, we still have advantages to boast of, some of which include: transaction across different service providers, bank account isn’t necessary in the SSCaT model, ability to maintain local domain, etc. 
>> Productive future plans for SSCaT: including merging of SSCaT account with bank account, use of NFC technology to eleminate the need of service providers, etc.
